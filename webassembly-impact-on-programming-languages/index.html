With Wasi, Wasm could become a major way to deploy workloads on Edge and Cloud platforms. You will find more information on <a href=https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen>https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen</a>.</p><p>I think it is important to differentiate 2 use cases: languages used to write Wasm components and languages used to consume them. Could be the same language for both, but I think we will see some languages more used for a use case and less for the other.</p><p>I think WebAssembly components will typically be implemented with languages like Rust or Zig for new code. Or with C/C++ for the huge ecosystem already developed with those languages. The glue code (the application) where various components are assembled with the business logic will IMO be typically developed with statically-typed garbage-collected languages. WebAssembly Garbage Collector support is making good progresses in order to make Wasm a great target platform for those languages.</p><p>It is still unclear which language(s) will lead that space.</p><p>About Java, I tend to think it is unlikely to see Oracle investing massively in Wasm because ultimately, it is a JVM killer. Maybe
the <a href=https://www.graalvm.org/>GraalVM</a> team will work on native image compiler generating Wasm files instead of native executables. The more serious champion for Java to Wasm these days is Google with <a href=https://github.com/google/j2cl>J2CL</a> (currently frontend oriented, Wasi is not yet a target). <a href=https://github.com/fermyon/teavm-wasi>TeaVM-WASI</a>, a friendly fork of TeaVM, modified to support WASI and the WebAssembly Component Model, is also worth to follow.</p><p>.NET and C# are good candidates with pioneers like <a href=https://twitter.com/stevensanderson>Steve Sanderson</a> who worked early on Blazor and their recent work on Wasi, but there are limitations (no GC proposal support).</p><p>After pivoting to the mobile with <a href=https://flutter.dev/>Flutter</a>, curious to see <a href=https://medium.com/dartlang/experimenting-with-dart-and-wasm-ef7f1c065577>Dart upcoming Wasm support</a>.</p><p><a href=https://www.swift.org/>Swift</a> could be in theory a great candidate, and <a href=https://swiftwasm.org/>SwiftWasm</a> community is doing an amazing work, but IMO Apple won&rsquo;t invest too much there.</p><p><a href=https://kotlinlang.org/>Kotlin</a> with their early but promising Kotlin/Wasm effort is probably my favorite one. Lack of short term plan for Wasi support and JVM-focused tooling are current main limitations IMO.</p><p>Wasm is likely to play a big role in Python future with <a href=https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide>Pyodide</a> and
<a href=https://pyscript.net/>Pyscript</a> for data science but footprint and dynamic typing may prevent dominating the application space.</p><p><a href=https://www.typescriptlang.org/>TypeScript</a> has been designed as a superset of JavaScript, so not sure WebAssembly will become a major target.</p><p><a href=https://www.assemblyscript.org/>AssemblyScript</a> is a TypeScript-like language compiling to Wasm but it is unclear if it will evolve to become a general purpose language.</p><p><a href=https://go.dev/>Go</a> compiler generates huge Wasm files, <a href=https://tinygo.org/>TinyGo</a> optimized ones but it supports only a subset of the use cases and is not &ldquo;the official one&rdquo; so not sure how that will evolve.</p><p>Notice there are other languages specifically designed for Wasm like <a href=https://grain-lang.org/>Grain</a>, or where Wasm is a key target like <a href=https://github.com/titzer/virgil>Virgil</a> from <a href=https://twitter.com/TitzerBL>Ben Titzer</a> and likely many other ones to come.</p><p>Middle term, I expect efficiency of compilation to Wasm, WIT and Wasi interoperability to become key differentiators impacting programming languages adoption massively.</p><p>PS.
